## Clean Architecure Bookstore

Demo app implementing Clean Architecture with separation/modularization by layer. Allows users to browse through books which topped The New York TimesÂ® Fiction Best Seller list (see [NYT API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview)). Covers fetched via [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/). Based on this [talk](https://academy.realm.io/posts/converting-an-app-to-use-clean-architecture/) and this [repo](https://github.com/bufferapp) by Joe Birch.
